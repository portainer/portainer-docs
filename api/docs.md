# API documentation

Portainer exposes an HTTP API that you can use to automate everything you do via the Portainer UI. You can also use Portainer as a gateway (HTTP queries against the Portainer API) to the underlying Docker/Kubernetes API.

{% hint style="info" %}
You will need an access token in order to use the Portainer API. If you have not already set up an access token for the API, we have [instructions on how to do so](access.md).
{% endhint %}

You can find our API documentation at SwaggerHub. We have also provided some examples of API usage.
