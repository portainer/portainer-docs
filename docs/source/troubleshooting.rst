Portainer is built to run on Docker. If Docker is not configured correctly, then this can cause issues that appear to be coming from Portainer.

Ensuring Docker is configured correctly
=======================================

The first thing to look at whether Docker is actually functioning correctly on your system.

::

  $ docker version

The above command should have returned information about Docker running on your system. Below is a snippet of what this may look like.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ Client: Docker Engine - Community
      Version:           19.03.3
      API version:       1.40
      Go version:        go1.12.10
      Git commit:        a872fc2f86
      Built:             Tue Oct  8 00:59:59 2019
      OS/Arch:           linux/amd64
      Experimental:      false

Ensuring Docker Swarm is configured correctly
=============================================

All nodes will require the following ports to be open:

* 7946/tcp
* 7946/udp
* 4789/udp

For the manager node:

* 2377/tcp

If using UFW add the docker ports like this:

```sudo ufw allow 4789/udp && sudo ufw allow 2377/tcp && sudo ufw allow 2376/udp && sudo ufw allow 4722/tcp && sudo ufw reload && sudosystemctl restart docker```

This way portainer and docker can still see each other and keeping the firewall intact


Next, make sure you are using the ``--advertise-addr`` option.

- When creating the cluster via ``docker swarm init``, use ``--advertise-addr`` with either the private IP address or NIC name directly (``--advertise-addr eth1`` for example)
- When joining a cluster on worker nodes via ``docker swarm join``, use ``--advertise-addr`` the same as above with either private IP address or NIC name directly
