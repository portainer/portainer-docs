# Add a local environment

You can only add a local environment when the Portainer Server container is being created. You cannot add a local environment after Portainer is deployed.

For more information about the installation process, visit the [Getting Started](../../../start/intro.md) section (in particular, the [installation steps](../../../start/install/)).
