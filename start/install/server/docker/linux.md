# Install Portainer with Docker on Linux

{% hint style="info" %}
These instructions are for Portainer Community Edition. For Business Edition, please refer to the [Business Edition documentation](https://docs.portainer.io/v/be-2.7/).
{% endhint %}

## Introduction

Portainer consists of two elements, the _Portainer Server_, and the _Portainer Agent_. Both elements run as lightweight Docker containers on a Docker engine. This document will help you install the Portainer Server container on your Linux environment. To add a new Linux environment to an existing Portainer Server installation, please refer to the [Portainer Agent installation instructions](../../agent/docker/linux.md).

To get started, you will need:

* The latest version of Docker installed and working
* sudo access on the machine that will host your Portainer Server instance
* By default, Portainer Server will expose the UI over port `9443` and expose a TCP tunnel server over port `8000`. The latter is optional and is only required if you plan to use the Edge compute features with Edge agents.

The installation instructions also make the following assumptions about your environment:

* Your environment meets [our requirements](../../../requirements-and-prerequisites.md). While Portainer may work with other configurations, it may require configuration changes or have limited functionality.
* You are accessing Docker via Unix sockets. Alternatively, you can also connect via TCP.
* SELinux is disabled on the machine running Docker. If you require SELinux, you will need to pass the `--privileged` flag to Docker when deploying Portainer.
* Docker is running as root. Portainer with rootless Docker has some limitations, and requires additional configuration.

## Deployment

First, create the volume that Portainer Server will use to store its database:

```bash
docker volume create portainer_data
```

Then, download and install the Portainer Server container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name portainer \
    --restart=always \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v portainer_data:/data \
    cr.portainer.io/portainer/portainer-ce
```

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, Portainer generates and uses a self-signed SSL certificate to secure port `9443`. Alternatively you can provide your own SSL certificate [during installation](../../../../advanced/ssl.md#docker-standalone) or [via the Portainer UI](../../../../admin/settings/#ssl-certificate) after installation is complete.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you require HTTP port `9000` open for legacy reasons, add the following to your `docker run` command:

`-p 9000:9000`
{% endhint %}

Portainer Server has now been installed. You can check to see whether the Portainer Server container has started by running `docker ps`:

```bash
root@server:~# docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                          COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS      PORTS                                                                                  NAMES             
de5b28eb2fa9   portainer/portainer-ce         "/portainer"             2 weeks ago   Up 9 days   0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp, :::8000->8000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9443->9443/tcp, :::9443->9443/tcp   portainer
```

## Logging In

Now that the installation is complete, you can log into your Portainer Server instance by opening a web browser and going to:

```bash
https://localhost:9443
```

Replace `localhost` with the relevant IP address or FQDN if needed, and adjust the port if you changed it earlier.

You will be presented with the initial setup page for Portainer Server.
